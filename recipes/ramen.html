    <h1>Ramen</h1>

    <p>Ramen is believed to have originated in China, and it's unclear precisely 
        when it was introduced to Japan. But ramen is a mainstay of Japanese 
        cuisine, and throughout Asia. Though it's commonly associated in the 
        U.S. with packaged, dried noodles, the way to truly understand ramen is 
        to think of it as a soup dish that contains noodles, not merely the 
        noodles themselves. 

        There are four basic categories of ramen, and each one is distinguished 
        by the type of broth the soup is made from. Shoyu ramen, the most common,
         is made from a chicken broth base flavored with soy sauce. Shio ramen 
         features a thinner chicken broth seasoned with salt. Miso ramen is 
         thicker and heartier, with a rich, brown broth flavored with miso, or 
         fermented soybean paste. And tonkotsu ramen is made from simmered pork 
         bones, resulting in a thick, creamy, fatty broth.</p>

        <li>Garlic and ginger</li>
        <li>Broth (chicken or veg)</li>
        <li>Dried shiitake mushrooms</li>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir-Fry Aromatics: Garlic and ginger, what a delicious duo. 
            This is where the flavor is, friends.</li>
        <li>Make Your (Easy!) Broth: Add some chicken broth and dried shiitake 
            mushrooms for some umami punch.</li>
        <li>Add Noodles: Cook your noodles right in the broth with some scallions 
            (more flavor, please!).</li>
        <li>Add Veg: Thinly sliced kale, shredded carrots, whatever you'd like! 
            Cook until just tender.</li>
        <li>Top It Off: Add some crunchy panko crumbs, a soft-boiled egg,

    </ol>
    <p>
    Simmering some garlic, ginger, and dried mushrooms with your chicken 
    broth makes for a great quickie “stock”. A good while in the pot will 
    get some nice flavors going that will soon be soaked up by those noodles. And by good while, I mean 19 minutes, because the whole thing takes 20. The soft egg on top will get you all the Instagram likes, and the panko and extra chili oil or Sriracha will light your mouth up with joy.

    At the end of the day, a deep bowl of bright veggies + flavorful broth 
    + golden panko crumbs + soft-boiled egg + chewy, tangled noodles is not 
    going to let you down.</p>
