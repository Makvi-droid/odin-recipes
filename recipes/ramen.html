    <p>Ramen is believed to have originated in China, and it's unclear precisely 
        when it was introduced to Japan. But ramen is a mainstay of Japanese 
        cuisine, and throughout Asia. Though it's commonly associated in the 
        U.S. with packaged, dried noodles, the way to truly understand ramen is 
        to think of it as a soup dish that contains noodles, not merely the 
        noodles themselves. 

        There are four basic categories of ramen, and each one is distinguished 
        by the type of broth the soup is made from. Shoyu ramen, the most common,
         is made from a chicken broth base flavored with soy sauce. Shio ramen 
         features a thinner chicken broth seasoned with salt. Miso ramen is 
         thicker and heartier, with a rich, brown broth flavored with miso, or 
         fermented soybean paste. And tonkotsu ramen is made from simmered pork 
         bones, resulting in a thick, creamy, fatty broth.</p>
